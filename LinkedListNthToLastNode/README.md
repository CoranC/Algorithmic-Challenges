# Nth To Last Node

## Definition
Given an integer n, find the the nth last node in a linked list.
For example, if there are 10 linked nodes with values ranging from 1 to 10 and n == 8.
nth_last_node(2, head_node) would return 8 (8 being the value of the 2nd last node)

## Task
1. Create an nth_last_node function that takes n and the head node as arguments.
2. Create tests for the function.
