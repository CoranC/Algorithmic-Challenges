#Caesar Cipher

##Definition
A Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

##Task
1. Create a CaesarCipher Class that encodes and decodes a message strictly in uppercase (regardless of how the text is passed in).
2. The Algorithm should run in O(n) time or better.
3. The rotation should be modifable even after the object has been created.
4. Test cases should be provided for the CaesarCipher class implemented.
