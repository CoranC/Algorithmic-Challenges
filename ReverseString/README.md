# Reverse String

## Definition
Reverse a given string so that the words appear in the opposite direction: E.g. "How are you" becomes "you are How"

## Task
1. Create a rev_word function that reverses a given string so that the words appear in the opposite direction
2. The Algorithm should run in O(n) time or better.
3. Create a pythonic and non pythonic implementation of the function to show knowledge of Python and Algorithmic thinking.
4. All leading and trailing white space should be removed.
4. Test cases should be provided for the rev_word functions.
