#Anagram Check
##Definition
Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word).

##Task
1. Create an anagram function.
2. Ignore spaces and capitalization. So "d go" is an anagram of "God" and "dog" and "o d g".
3. Assume strings will be passed in as inputs.
4. Assume no punctuation characters will be passed in as arguments.

##Solution
An algorithm that runs in O(n) time by comparing sorted strings.
